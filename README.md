# Fatal-Exceptions
A repository for a game I am developing called Fatal Exceptions. Inspired by the FNAF series. If the HTML file does not work on your device (Desktop or mobile), the link in this file's github description should work for you. 

CONTROLS
Click the light button next to the window to use the light in the window. 
Click space (on mobile, click the button on the bottom of the screen) to acess the cameras. 
Click the light buttons next to the two monitors on your left to turn on the door lights. 
Click the door buttons next to those monitors to close and open the doors. 
If something is in your window, use the tazer button (the button with the lightning bolt symbol) to draw them away.
